Salesforce Lightning Design system component kit for Sketch. A Style based design system leveraging symbol overrides empowering designers to create accurate designs in a flash.
**This system will ensure consistency and continuity across teams.**

# How to use this kit
### Basic Kit Usage
The best way to use this kit, if you know you may need access to the majority of the styles, is to use the included **SLDS Starter**

The SLDS Starter is a blank file, but has all the symbols already added for you in the symbols page.

### Using Symbols
This system is entirely based upon symbols. Any symbol can be added from the symbols menu: **Insert -> Symbol -> {symbol name}**. There you will find all major symbols listed alphabetically.

Or if using [Sketch runner ](http://sketchrunner.com/), which i highly recommend, you can just type the name of the symbol you are looking for.



### Symbol overrides
Symbol overrides are the heart of this system, as everything is style based. Not all symbols structures are created identical, however they all maintain some level of consistency.

Once a symbol has been added to the page you can elect it and **use the "Overrides" in the right sidebar to control the appearance of the symbol.**
