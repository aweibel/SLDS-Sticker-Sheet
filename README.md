Salesforce Lightning Design system component kit for Sketch. A Style based design system leveraging symbol overrides empowering designers to create accurate designs in a flash.
**This system will ensure consistency and continuity across teams.**

# How to use the kit
### Basic Kit Usage
The best way to use this kit, if you know you may need access to the majority of the styles, is to use the included **SLDS Starter**

The SLDS Starter is a blank file, but has all the symbols already added for you in the symbols page.

### Using Symbols
This system is entirely based upon symbols. Any symbol can be added from the symbols menu: **Insert -> Symbol -> {symbol name}**. There you will find all major symbols listed alphabetically.





Or if using [Sketch runner ](http://sketchrunner.com/), which i highly recommend, you can just type the name of the symbol you are looking for.

### Symbol overrides
Not all symbols are created identical. However they all maintain some level of consistency.

# Object Structure

### Buttons
Rename Multiple layers at once. You can access it from the menu **Plugins -> Rename It -> Rename Selected Layers** or use the shortcut **⌃+⌘+R**


### Forms
Type “%N” to name layer in sequence. You can also use “%n” for reverse order. The more Ns you add the more digits it will add (e.g. , Item %N ==> Item 1, Item 2, Item 3).
You can also set where to start the sequence from.
